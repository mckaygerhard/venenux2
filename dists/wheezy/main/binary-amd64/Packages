Description: Docker: the open-source application container engine
 Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run any application as a
 lightweight container
 .
 Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
 they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and
 everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular
 language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks
 for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without
 depending on a particular stack or provider.

 Node.js is bundled with several useful libraries to handle server tasks :

 HTTP, Multipart Parsing, TCP, DNS, Assert, Path, URL, Query Strings.
